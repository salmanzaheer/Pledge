## A web-based application to send and receive payments using customized payment options!

### Developed by Brittany Agha, Christopher Yue, Tosin Idowu & Salman Zaheer



## OVERVIEW

Pledge is primarily a monetizable business, with a humanitarian aspect. The donation aspect of the application allows donors to pledge a payment which can be completed with negotiated conditions between them and the organization. Pledge is a payment application that works to provide buyers and sellers with flexible and negotiable custom payment plans that work for both parties. This application will make profit in a variety of ways, some of which are like other payments applications. Profit will be made through instant transfer, small transaction fees, and premium features discussed below. Though there already exist applications like Klarna and Afterpay that specialize in payment plans, Pledge allows users more freedom. Pledge will also work to cater more toward small sellers and businesses.


### At Pledge, our mission is to provide quick, safe, reliable, flexible, and low-cost payment resolution to sellers and consumers.
